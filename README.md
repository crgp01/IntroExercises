FizzBuzz Exercise
  
        FizzBuzz is a simple number game where you count, but say "Fizz" and/or "Buzz" instead of numbers adhering to certain rules
        
        Create a FizzBuzz() method that prints out the numbers 1 through 100.
        Instead of numbers divisible by three print "Fizz".
        Instead of numbers divisible by five print "Buzz".
        Instead of numbers divisible by three and five print "FizzBuzz".

Prime Factors Exercise

        Write a method generate(int n) that given an integer N will return a list of integers such that the numbers are the factors of N and are arranged in increasing numerical order.
